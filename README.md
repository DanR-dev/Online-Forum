# Online Forum
This project was the primary graded component of my Web Apps module in university. For this coursework I was to build a basic online forum, and then incrementally add as many features as possible from a list. These features were mostly from a technical perspective, such as implementing various relationships in a database, setting up security protocols and handling file exchanges. The final product would then be graded on the features, the quality of their implementation and how well it followed professional standards. The features.mp4 file is a short video demonstrating each feature I was able to implement.
